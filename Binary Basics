# Binary Basics
- Binary code is a coding system using only the digits 1 and 0 in order to represent a letter, digit, or other character in a computer.
- It is a series of 8 digits per character.
- Essentially is flipping the 8 bits "on" or "off"
  - 1 is "on"
  - 0 is "off"
 
Binary is important because it enabled devices to store, access, and manipulate all types of information that is directed to and from a computer's CPU/memory.
